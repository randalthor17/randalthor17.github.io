Hello, and welcome! To freshers, congratulations! This post will attempt to describe what Materials and Metallurgical Engineering (MME) is all about, from the perspective of a student who has completed his first semester. MME might be a mostly unknown field to most people in the country, but it is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and exciting fields of engineering, especially in this day and age of rapid technological advancement, and the demand of more and more advanced materials to keep up with the pace of innovation.

### WTF is MME?

The first question that appears in MME freshers' minds is often **"What exactly is Materials and Metallurgical Engineering?"** Let's face it, it's not a very well-known field in our country, and 99% of ordinary people haven't even heard that name. As such, let's try to answer that question first. MME is basically the study of properties of materials. This might sound underwhelming at first (especially compared to other well-known fields such as CSE and EEE), but it's actually a very broad and interdisciplinary field that encompasses aspects of physics, chemistry, and engineering.

In this field, we study why materials behave the way they do, how to get desired properties from materials, and how to develop new materials with specific properties for various applications. The materials in question can be metals, polymers, ceramics, composites or even novel materials such as nanomaterials, semiconductors, superconductors, biomaterials and so on.

### "Materials" vs "Metallurgy"

The word "**metallurgy**" is also very much unknown to most people. Metallurgy is the field focusing on metals, their alloys (think of steel, brass, bronze etc.) and their processing (extraction, casting, forging, welding, heat treatment etc.). This is a very old field, dating back to ancient times when humans first started using metals for tools and weapons, and it is still very important to our daily life. Things such as steel used in construction, copper used in electrical wiring, and aluminium used in aerospace are all products of metallurgy.

However, materials science and engineering is a much broader field that encompasses not only metals but also other types of materials such as polymers, ceramics, composites, and more. As such, MME is a more comprehensive field that covers both metallurgy and materials science.

### What to get excited for?

Because of the rapidly advancing technology at this point in time, there are a lot of new advancements in the field of material science. Some topics that I can think of on top of my head are:

- **Aerospace**: Airplane frames are made of lightweight aluminum alloys, titanium, composites such as carbon fiber, and so on. The turbine blades are made of monocrystalline nickel superalloys that can withstand the harsh hot environment inside the turbines. All of these are relatively new inventions in the field, driven by the need for ever lighter but stronger materials. The rocket industry is another matter altogether, being a cutting edge field that is being propelled forward by the advancements in stronger, more space-resilient materials.

- **Biomaterials**: Material science is working hand in hand with biomedical engineering in order to create safe, biocompatible, strong and lightweight materials to make implants, artificial joints and scaffolding, and so on.

- **Energy**: From older lead acid batteries to modern Li-ion, Li-polymer, and even cutting-edge technologies such as solid-state batteries are driven by the advancement of material science. New perovskite solar cells are being developed, which, combined with traditional semiconductor solar cells, offer a new paradigm that will boost solar cell efficiency. In case of nuclear reactors, material science allows them to withstand the high temperatures and continuous neutron bombardment inside them, and material science is enabling cutting-edge research on promising fusion reactor designs such as the Tokomak.

- **Semiconductors**: Semiconductivity is inherently a field of material science. Continuous advancements in material science are enabling Moore's law to stay true, and thus transistors are able to be made smaller, cheaper, and more efficient.

- **Superconductors**: More and more high-temperature superconductors are making projects like Japan's MagLev trains and MRI machines possible. The same technology is being used in particle accelerators and fusion reactors for its ability to make very powerful magnetic fields.

- **Manufacturing**: Novel manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and resin printing had paved the way for fast, hobbyist-grade prototyping, easing R&D significantly.

### Prospects in BD and abroad

I'm only in my second semester of university, and as such, my ideas about this part are lacking depth. I'll try to write down what I kmow to the best of my ability.

#### Prospects in BD

I'll be honest, just like every other engineering field in the country, MME has few engineering specific jobs that a graduate would like to work on. If I try to outline what options engineers have here, it's either very specific industry jobs (that don't pay nearly enough, or even when they do, they are quite work-intensive but haypve little scope for innovation), or Govt. job posts such as Assistant Engineer (IDK if I even have to mention how little they pay, but on top of that, the job fields are taken up by Diploma degree holders, and it's downright impossible to get promoted without some sort of "influence"). All that is to say, the best jobs for engineers (including MME graduates) in this country are the rare R&D jobs, or academia. 

As such, there are basically 3 kinds of jobs for MME graduates in this country:

- **Industry**: MME exists in this country because of demands of the steel industry. As such, there is a demand for MME graduates in it. Other than that, the other metal-based industries (aluminium and copper, to name a few), ceramic, glass and polymer (plastics) industries also hide MME graduates.

- **Academia and R&D**: Govt. research institutions such as BCSIR and BSTI offer research positions. Some graduates stay in academia instead, pursuing research in fields such as metallurgy and nanomaterials alongside teaching students. (Some senior teachers are consultants in the industry, and dare I say this pays WELL)

- **Govt. jobs**: There are Govt. jobs for MME graduates, though they are rare. Many engineering graduates end up going the BCS Admin Cadre route though, and MME is no different.
