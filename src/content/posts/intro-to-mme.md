Hello, and welcome! To freshers, congratulations! This post will attempt to describe what Materials and Metallurgical Engineering (MME) is all about, from the perspective of a student who has completed his first semester. MME might be a mostly unknown field to most people in the country, but it is undoubtedly one of the most versatile and exciting fields of engineering, especially in this day and age of rapid technological advancement, and the demand of more and more advanced materials to keep up with the pace of innovation.

### WTF is MME?

The first question that appears in MME freshers' minds is often **"What exactly is Materials and Metallurgical Engineering?"** Let's face it, it's not a very well-known field in our country, and 99% of ordinary people haven't even heard that name. As such, let's try to answer that question first. MME is basically the study of properties of materials. This might sound underwhelming at first (especially compared to other well-known fields such as CSE and EEE), but it's actually a very broad and interdisciplinary field that encompasses aspects of physics, chemistry, and engineering.

In this field, we study why materials behave the way they do, how to get desired properties from materials, and how to develop new materials with specific properties for various applications. The materials in question can be metals, polymers, ceramics, composites or even novel materials such as nanomaterials, semiconductors, superconductors, biomaterials and so on.

### "Materials" vs "Metallurgy"

The word "metallurgy" is also very much unknown to most people. Metallurgy is the field focusing on metals, their alloys (think of steel, brass, bronze etc.) and their processing (extraction, casting, forging, welding, heat treatment etc.). This is a very old field, dating back to ancient times when humans first started using metals for tools and weapons, and it is still very important to our daily life. Things such as steel used in construction, copper used in electrical wiring, and aluminium used in aerospace are all products of metallurgy.

However, materials science and engineering is a much broader field that encompasses not only metals but also other types of materials such as polymers, ceramics, composites, and more. As such, MME is a more comprehensive field that covers both metallurgy and materials science.
